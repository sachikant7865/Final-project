                    <p>Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German Eugen Sandow, now considered as the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding". He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. The Oscar-winning 1936 musical film The Great Ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.</p>

                        <p>Unlike proteins and fats, carbohydrates are considered non-essential for the human diet because the body has the ability to produce glucose needed by tissues through gluconeogenesis [54]. However, carbohydrate intake has an important role in the bodybuilder’s diet as a regulator of thyroid hormones and as a contributor to micronutrient needs [55,56]. Further, a very low carb diet could limit regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and limit the muscles’ ability to contract with high force [57,58].</p>

                        <p>Sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined dumbbells, spring pulleys, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in "cabinet cards" and other prints.</p>

                        <p>Bodybuilding is more than a sport; it is an art and culture. It differentiates itself from performance sports as the athletes are judged on appearance rather than athletic ability on competition day. Bodybuilders pose onstage where they are judged on muscularity, definition, and symmetry. During a season, bodybuilders go through three different phases: muscle-gaining phase (off-season), dieting for competition (contest preparation) and the competition itself.</p>

                        <p>Positive energy balance has been shown to have an important anabolic effect, even in the absence of resistance training [10]. However, combining a positive energy balance with resistance training provides the most effective method to ensure the anabolic effects are directed toward increasing skeletal muscle mass.</p>

                        <p>Essential amino acids (EAA) are the only amino acids required to stimulate the process of MPS. While all amino acids provide the necessary “building blocks” for the synthesis of new tissue, the amino acid leucine in particular appears to be especially important as a “metabolic trigger” of MPS. A sufficient concentration of leucine has been suggested to be necessary to reach a “leucine threshold” which is required to maximally stimulate MPS .</p>
